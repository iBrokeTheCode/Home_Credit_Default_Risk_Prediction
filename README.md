## 1. Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict a client's ability to repay a loan. It is a binary classification task that uses a real-world financial dataset to identify clients who may face payment difficulties.

The project goes beyond a standard model by including a practical application that:

- **Preprocesses and cleans the dataset** for model training.
- **Trains a machine learning model** to predict loan repayment risk.
- **Deploys an interactive predictor app** using Marimo, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Allows users to make predictions** by providing the top 10 most influential features.

This work showcases a complete end-to-end workflow, transforming raw data into a functional, user-friendly tool for risk assessment.

## 2. Methodology & Key Features

- **Model Selection:** Four different models were trained and evaluated, with **LightGBM** selected as the final model due to its superior performance, achieving a **ROC AUC score of 0.751** on the test set.
- **Automated Preprocessing:** The data preprocessing pipeline handles common tasks such as feature scaling and categorical encoding, ensuring the model receives clean and formatted data.
- **Interactive Predictor:** An application built with **Marimo** allows users to interact with the trained model directly. It uses the **top 10 most important features**‚Äîidentified from the final LightGBM model‚Äîto generate real-time predictions.

## 3. Technology Stack

This project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

**Dashboard & Hosting:**
